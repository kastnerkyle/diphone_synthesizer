t2p_align.pl   takes in a dictionary and outputs the best
               alignments it can make, i phone (or null) 
               for each letter.     (.align)

con2vec.pl     converts the alignments into oservation
               vectors for training (.vec)

t2p_id3.pl     builds the decision tree and writes the 
               perl subroutine      (e.g. r1d7.pl)

t2p_dt.pl      runs the text-to-phone engine once the
               decision tree has been built.  starting
               this with no args goes into interactive
               mode; giving it a file, it expects that
               file to be an aligned dictionary to
               test against.

The above should be runnable with perl 5.004 with a simple
change of the #!/usr/bin/perl path to perl at the tops
of the scripts.

Included is also the cmu58k94.dic, its resultant alignments,
the observation vectors generated from the alignments,
in cmu58k94.dic, cmu58k94.dic.align, and cmu58k94.dic.vec
respectively.

r1d7.pl is the dtree from cmu58k94.dic, and t2p_dt.pl
is currently set up to use it, so it should run out
of the box.

Results were 79% word/95% phone on cmu58k94.dic for
full-depth tree.  Be wary of the code sizes of deep 
trees.
